APOLOGY

Dear Family, 

	Sorry for my misbehavior. I realize that I have been acting like a buffoon the past couple of days. I am truly sorry. When I get nervous I have a tendency to let it out on others. The past week, my anxiety built up because of the I-ready test. If I did not do well on it my grade would have plummeted. However, I also got scared because of the Walnut Creek tournament. All I could think of was the swirling storm of the upcoming matches. I usually think of table tennis tournaments as extremely stressful, but when I start playing, my dark thoughts vanish and I am back to normal--I am ready to win. Nevertheless, I act like an idiot before the tournaments because I have pent-up nervousness. Because of that, I was bugging you guys to let me participate in the soccer game today. So I am sorry for all the collateral damage I caused--the trim, your good side, etc. 
	From now on I will have changed. I will look forward to table tennis events because I know that I will have loads of fun winning. If you say no for anything I want to attend, I will not keep after your tail like a spoiled brat. Additionally, I will not whine about coming with my only family to LA next weekend. 
	Through writing this apology, I have come to my senses and changed. I am a mature 13-year-old and not a stupid moron. I am not a parasite, a ticking time bomb, a leech, nor am I psycho, a nag, a brat, nor am I your impediment--I am your aid after all, and if I havenâ€™t shown it yet, I will now. Thank you for giving me a second chance to prove my worth. Thank you for taking care of me and sharpening me into the best possible human.

Bye, 
Your smart-ass AK
